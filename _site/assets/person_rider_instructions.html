            <p>Our goal is to classify the highlighted-in-pink <i>mask</i> (blob of pixels) belonging to a human as either a "person (non-rider)", or as a "bicyclist/motorcyclist". </p>
            <font style="color:red"> <b>A "Bicyclist/Motorcyclist" is defined as a human relying on a 2- or 3-wheeled device for movement.</b> </font> This includes riders of bicycles or motorcycles. </p>

        <p>
        On the other hand, <font color="red"> a "person (non-rider)" is anyone who is NOT a "Bicyclist/Motorcyclist" </font>. Thus, a <b>person</b> includes any other kind of human drivers, passengers, or riders of scooters, skateboards, surfboards, snow skis, horses, Segways, (inline) skates, wheelchairs, road cleaning cars, or convertibles. </p>
        <p> <b> <i> We will be checking the quality of your work against pre-labeled image ground truth, so please be very careful about your work in order to be paid. </i> </b> </p>
            
      You will see 3 versions of the same image, arranged in a row. From left to right, they will be the original image, then the blob of pixels associated with the human (the "mask") highlighted in pink in the image, and then the pink human pixels only against a light blue background.

      Sometimes the pink pixels will be hard to find. <b> You will probably need to zoom in to see the people clearly. </b>

      <div>
      <p><b> In the image below, all of the people are "persons", since they are not riding anything. </b></p>

      <div>
      <p> Below, although the blue screen seems blank, there is a tiny "person (non-rider)". You'll need to zoom in to see the pink pixels, which correspond to a human that is definitely not a bicyclist or motorcyclist (although they are tiny and you'll need to zoom in a lot).</p>
