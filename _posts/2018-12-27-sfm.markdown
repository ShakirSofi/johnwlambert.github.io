## A Basic Structure-from-Motion (SFM) Pipeline

As described in [1], there are generally four steps to the algorithm:
- (1) Find interest points in each image
- (2) Find candidate correspondences (match descriptors for each interest point)
- (3) Perform geometric verification of correspondences (RANSAC + fundamental matrix)
- (4) Solve for 3D points and camera that minimize reprojection error.

## Cost Functions/Error Modelling

The choice of cost function quantifies the total prediction error of the model. It measures how well the model fits the observations and background knowledge.

### Reprojection Error for a Single Keypoint in Two Images

Imagine we have matched two keypoints, $$x_1,x_2$$ in two different images $$I_1,I_2$$ via a SIFT-like feature matching pipeline. We are viewing the projection of the same 3D point $$\mathbf{X}$$ in both images. We now wish to identify the coordinates describing the location of $$\mathbf{X}$$.

If image $$I_1$$ was captured with projection matrix $$M_1$$, and image $$I_2$$ was captured with projection matrix $$M_2$$, we can enforce that the 3D point $$\mathbf{X}$$ is projected into the image into the right location in both images. This is called *triangulation*.

If the camera calibration determining $$M_1,M_2$$ are **known**, then the optimization problem for a single matched keypoint in two images becomes:

$$
\min_{\mathbf{X}} f(\mathbf{X}) = \| x_1 - Proj(\mathbf{X},M_1)\|^2 + \| x_2 - Proj(\mathbf{X},M_2)\|^2 
$$

### Reprojection Error for Many Keypoints in Many Cameras

Imagine now that we have $$m$$ different cameras, and each camera has a **known** projection matrix $$\{M_i\}_{i=1}^m$$. Suppose we match $$n$$ different keypoints across the images, denoted $$\{\mathbf{X}_j\}_{j=1}^n$$.

The optimization problem becomes:

$$
\min_{\mathbf{X}_1,\mathbf{X}_2, \dots} \sum\limits_{i=1}^m \sum\limits_{j=1}^n \| x_{ij} - Proj(\mathbf{X_j},M_i)\|^2 
$$

In this case $$x_{ij}$$ is the observed location of the $$j$$'th keypoint into the $$i$$'th image, as discovered by a keypoint detector in the SIFT-like pipeline. We penalize solutions for $$\mathbf{X}_1,\mathbf{X}_2,\dots$$ in which $$x_{ij}$$ is not very close to $$Proj(\mathbf{X_j},M_i)$$.

## Bundle Adjustment

Imagine now that we are working with arbitrary images for which we have no calibration information. Thus, the projection matrices $$\{M_i\}_{i=1}^m$$ are **unknown**.

Bundle adjustment is the process of minimizing reprojection error over (1) multiple 3D points and (2) multiple cameras. Triggs *et al.* define it as *"the problem of refining a visual reconstruction to produce jointly optimal structure and viewing parameter estimates"* [2]. The optimization problem changes only by adding new, additional variables for which we solve.

$$
\min_{\mathbf{X}_1,\mathbf{X}_2, \dots, M_1,M_2,\dots} \sum\limits_{i=1}^m \sum\limits_{j=1}^n \| x_{ij} - Proj(\mathbf{X_j},M_i)\|^2 
$$

According to [2], the name "Bundle Adjustment" refers to *bundles* of light rays leaving each 3D point and converging on each camera center, *"which are ‘adjusted’ optimally with respect to both feature and camera positions"*.

## Gauss-Newton

Gauss-Newton is generally preferred to Second Order methods like Newton's Method for a simple reason: deriving and implementing calculations of the second derivatives of the projection model $$Proj(X_j,M_i)$$ is difficult and error-prone [2].

For example, the seminal work in SfM, "Building Rome in a Day" [3] uses Trust-Region Gauss-Newton optimization (Levenberg-Marquardt) that chooses between a truncated and an exact step Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm.

## Exploiting Sparsity

Those who use generic optimization routines to solve SfM problems will find the optimization slow. This would be unwise, however, since the problem sparsity can be exploited.
