## Applications

Dynamic Programming (DP) ...

Linux utility `diff`, 



## Dynamic Programming

Longest Common Subsequence



## Integral Images

SURF, Viola Jones rely upon fast computation of Integral Images for fast local feature detection and object detection. Dynamic Programming 

## Max-Pooling in ConvNets

[1]

## Graphical Models

Koller and Friedman [2] use DP extensively. Variable Elimination (pp. 292-296, 337) for the summation of the joint distribution from the inside out, rather from the outside in, and cache the intermediate results to avoid repeated computation.

DP also arises in Belief Propagation (p. 356), Clique Tree Queries (p. 371), MAP and marginal MAP queries (p. 596).
