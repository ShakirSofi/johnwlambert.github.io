## The Need for More Finely-Grained Measures of Accuracy

We'll suppose that we are performing binary classification: classifying objects into different classes.

Mean Average Precision involves computing the area under a curve (an integral), and can actually be quite confusing.

### Recall

Recall measures how many objects you missed. You can have very high recall by classifying everythin as some class (at the expense of precision).

$$
\mbox{Recall} = \frac{tp}{tp+fn}
$$


### Precision

Precision measures your discriminative ability. If you claimed that all of the objects you saw were of a particular class, and you were usually wrong because they belonged to a different class, you would have low precision. Your judgments can't be considered *precise*.

$$
\mbox{Precision} = \frac{tp}{tp+fp}
$$


## Mean Average Precision

When performing the task of object detection, we would like to be discriminative not just about two classes
